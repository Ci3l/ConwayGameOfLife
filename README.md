![](assets/LifeGame.gif)

### Description
Creating a [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) for NumWorks calculators (N 100 and N 110) in Python using [Kandinsky package](https://www.numworks.com/fr/ressources/python/activites/kandinsky/).

### Usage
There's a pc version available if you need it in the 'test pc vers' directory.
About the NumWorks version, you can found it on the NumWorks website [here](https://my.numworks.com/python/ciel/conway) you just need to use the command below:
```
start(generation, length, width)
```
There are three sizes available:16/10; 32/20; 40/25
And if you don't really need all these parameters, there are default values so you can also simply enter:
```
start()
```
### View Project
If you want to test the project, you can go on the NumWorks website and test it on the integrated emulator [here](https://my.numworks.com/python/ciel/conway) (just click on the 'play logo'.) Or else you can use the PC version available in the 'test pc vers' directory.
